**Troubleshooting Wi-Fi Connectivity Issues**

If you are unable to connect to the "InnovateCorp_Main" Wi-Fi network, please follow these steps before creating a support ticket.

**Step 1: Check Network Selection**
Ensure your device is trying to connect to "InnovateCorp_Main" and not another network like "InnovateCorp_Guest".

**Step 2: Forget and Reconnect**
On your device's Wi-Fi settings, find our network, select "Forget this Network," and then try to connect again. You will be prompted to enter your standard company password.

**Step 3: Restart Your Device**
A simple reboot of your laptop or mobile device solves most connection problems. Please turn your device off and on again.

**Step 4: Check Your Location**
If you are in a known weak-signal area, such as the underground parking or far corners of the 3rd floor, try moving closer to the center of the building.

**Escalation:**
If you have completed all the above steps and still cannot connect, please contact the IT Help Desk at extension 4357. Provide them with your location and device type.
